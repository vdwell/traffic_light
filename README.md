there is simple railway traffic light managment solution which is build on Arduino Nano.
there is controller which control state for each light over 433MHz radio channel.
the controller is managed by joystick by setting up red/green lights for permit/deny actions and single/double yellow to inform about speed restriction.
the controller keeps states for each traffic lights and push updated status after each change.
the solution has been made as a game for children.
